It hurts, my first thought.

But I'm not surrounded by boundless drakness.

I can see light, I can feel it.

这里是走廊

那边病房传来的哭声让人心如刀割

我知道怎么做了......

I once felt nowhere to go.

Thought there is no place for me expect afterlife.

or

I once felt nowhere to go.

No matter at school or at home.


I hate this world much for its limit place. 

我曾感到无路可走

来到学校，这里只有无尽的黑暗回忆

回到家中，亦如待在封闭的阴暗角落



天下之大

我曾暗恨为何无我一人容身之处



线索3
I was totally wrong.
My eyes were blinded by dilemma so I can never see the hope.
My hands were bounded by grudge so I can never receive the help.
My feets were tied by hate so I can never make the step.

Time to free myself.
但我又何尝不是禁锢着自己

被乌瘴遮盖的双眼，看不见他人为我送来的微光

被怨怼束缚的双手，总是将贴心的问候拒之门外

被仇恨捆绑的双脚，绝不会踏出理解他人的一步





线索4

能活下来真好.......我暗自庆幸

我看到我的路通往四方

每一条，都有人那样无私地爱着我

谢谢你们，这次，也让我学会勇敢地爱别人
